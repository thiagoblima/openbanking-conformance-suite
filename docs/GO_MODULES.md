> Just interested in a defined recovery strategy for the situation when a package disappears from github for example. Unlikely be if we define what happens ahead of time, reduces the risk and panic. And from a governance point of view it covers that base. So we need a recovery strategy defined.

I donâ€™t know what to do when a package disappears. Maybe look for an archived version?
